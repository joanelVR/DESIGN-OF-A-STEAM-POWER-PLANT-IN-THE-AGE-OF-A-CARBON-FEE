# DESIGN-OF-A-STEAM-POWER-PLANT-IN-THE-AGE-OF-A-CARBON-FEE
#### For this project, as an academic exercise to illustrate the effects of a carbon fee, I designed a 20 MW steam power plant that maximizes efficiency assuming a twenty-year life cycle and illustrate the effects of a carbon fee on plant profitability. A (24-7) continuous operations was assumed for both fuel use and power generation. A MATLAB code was generalized so that it could calculate and plot the desired cycle given different open feedwater heaters and turbines. The constraints were as follow:
  * T_max: 600 oC, P_max: 30 MPa (Note: These values are consistent with a modern supercritical vapor power plant.)
  * Maximum Turbine efficiency: 92.5%
  * Maximum Pump efficiency: 86%
  * Maximum Boiler efficiency: 88%
  * Minimum number feedwater heaters (open or closed): 1
  * Maximum number feedwater heaters (open or closed): 6
